When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Fill in your answer here

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you should be able to choose when to get new data from github servers.
    Also if the pull is done automatically and you are working from different computers, could be several inconsistences depending on when github does it automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch is only a version in the local machine, clone is used to copy repositories in local of from github and fork is only applicable in github.
    To download from github is clone, fork only for versioning other repositories

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That your local is updated and you can work with the last version is available in github

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Sending the code in zip files or something similar. Will be much more easier do it with git as there are no interlocks and collaboration gets much more easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    In branch you can test new functionalities or flavours while keeping a full and stable version in the master.
    The benefit is if every thing goes ok, after you can merge the branches, works like a safepoint
