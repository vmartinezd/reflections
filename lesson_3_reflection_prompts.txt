Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you should be able to choose when to get new data from github servers.
    Also if the pull is done automatically and you are working from different computers, could be several inconsistences depending on when github does it automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch is only a version in the local machine, clone is used to copy repositories in local of from github and fork is only applicable in github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That your local is updated and you can work with the last version is available in github
